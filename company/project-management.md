## Create sprint

When creating sprint add 3 __immortal__ tasks:

* Sprint perspective
* Test
* Sprint retrospective

All other issues must be sorted by start time:

* Sprint perspective
* __Setup project__
* __Convert design into PUG/SASS__
* __Develop frontend part (javascript)__
* Test
* Sprint retrospective
* __Client communication__ `teamfix`
* __Tasks description__ `teamfix`

### User stories

User story must be a copy of exact user story, just copy / paste text client wrote.

### Estimate stories

When estimating a story - first divide story into imaginary tasks and estimate each of task and calculate sum of them to understand story's estimate. Ceil number to closest in [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
